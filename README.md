The class is really nice if you like to know more about computer hardware and how it works. The class was not hard but not easy either, because the professors just read from the slides without explaining and then proceed to ask design questions in the exams which are far from what is shown in the class. For studying for the exams and the class I advise finding a good playlist on youtube and solving the questions from the book.
Regarding the projects they take a fair good amount of time, they are doeable but require good teamwork. Both of the projects that I uploaded do not function fully when all the modules are combined together, however each module and some combinations work just fine together. I am saying this based on the test benches sent by the assistants.
At the start of the course when you pick your teammates, pick hardworking ones that will start early and work as a team on the project as this will make your life way easier. I made my projects with the amazing [Onur Yavri](https://github.com/oyavri) and Erblina Nivokazi. They were great teammates and I had fun doing the projects with them, our times did not suit eachothers schedules very much that is probably why we couldnt fully debug joining everything together as we would try to combine everything together in the last day or two.
